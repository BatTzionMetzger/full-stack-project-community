# full-stack-project-community
We offer a platform for communities to create their own online community fair, where community members show items they are offering to give away by uploading an image of it, and other community members can browse through the different items and get contact info when they find something they like, or send an email directly through the site. Each community has a code and each member has to sign up and login using their own user name, password and community id.
